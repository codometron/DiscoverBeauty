Data science and makeup an unlikely combination? Not really! Sure cosmetics are  clubbed together in the retail consumer space and treated similar to other products, but I honestly think it deserves a little more TLC. The beauty industry (skin-care and makeup) is estimated to be worth a whopping 42 billion dollars. 

An interesting trend to note is the massive democratization of makeup with the advent of digital media. This has caused a shift in how millennials buy products. This clearly explains the rise of influencers with beauty blogs and youtube channels that have massive fan followings, and have marketing partnerships with big companies such as Lâ€™Oreal.

Ultimately, there is a lot of information to sift through. Though authoritative sources such as beautypedia and makeupalley have peer and expert reviews that can be accessed using searches and filters provided you know what you are looking for, it is hard to know where to begin if one is new to makeup. This was the motivation behind building a makeup recommender: To generate personalized recommendations for users based on products they like.
